# Attendance-project
This is a project created with python + Dart to take attendance of students using their unique phone mac address + their face image  for security, all hardware needed is just a router connected to a pc note that the router doesn't require internet connection nor do the students phones , everything is done using LAN computer networks

Steps to use:

1-download all the code files

2-pip install all the pre-requiteis if not already installed in your python environment

3-read the start code well and make sure all the importnat files are placed in the right destination (will be changed to be global in the next version)

4-download wireless network watcher application from the offical site and make sure its in the right destination mentioned in the code 

5-create a data list excel file (.csv specifically) consisting of students names in the fist columns and their mac addresses in the second column and make sure the data list is named and plcaed in the right location mentionted in the code 

6-now everything is ready to run ,just run the start code and then connect attending stundets phone to the smae router as your pc ,the application will run in the background and it will create an output file of studnets that their mac addresses are detected on the local network until the program is 
terminated by the operator to stop taking attendance
